## Project Demo
In this project demonstration video, we walk through the functionality of our COVID-19 prediction system. The video shows how users can input their symptoms through a simple web interface and instantly receive predictions on their COVID-19 status. The demonstration also highlights the ease of use, reliability, and accuracy of our model.

By watching the project demo, you'll gain a clear understanding of the features, the prediction logic, and the application's user-friendly interface.

## Introduction
COVID-19 has significantly impacted global health systems, and early detection remains crucial. This project helps users and healthcare providers to pre-screen individuals based on 20 known symptoms and behavioral patterns. We developed a logistic regression model and integrated it with a Flask-based web interface to deliver real-time results.

## Features
- Predicts COVID-19 result (Positive/Negative) based on 20 symptoms and behaviors.
- Simple and clean web interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Backend developed using Flask and Python.
- Logistic Regression model trained using real-world COVID dataset.
- Scalable design for integration with real hospital/clinic systems.

## Dataset
The model is trained using the dataset published on PeerJ Computer Science, which includes various symptoms, travel history, and sanitation practices.

- **Dataset Source:** PeerJ CS COVID-19 Dataset
- **Data Type:** Public
- **Preprocessing:** Feature scaling using StandardScaler, Label normalization (Yes/No), and train-test split using stratified sampling
## Technology used
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning:** Logistic Regression (scikit-learn)
- **Model Deployment:** Flask with pickle for model serialization

## Usage
- Enter 20 inputs (Yes/No) for symptoms and behavior (e.g., Fever, Dry Cough, Mask Wearing).
- Click the **"Predict"** button.
- Get a result: **COVID-19 Prediction: Positive/Negative**.
- Popup and overlay displays the result for better UI experience.
